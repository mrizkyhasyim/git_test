    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        Earth Science System (ESS) is the application of systems science to the Earth. 
        In particular, it considers interactions and 'feedbacks', through material and 
        energy fluxes, between the Earth's sub-systems' cycles, processes and "spheres"
        —atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, geosphere, pedosphere, lithosphere, 
        biosphere, and even the magnetosphere—as well as the impact of human societies 
        on these components. At its broadest scale, Earth science system brings together 
        researchers across both the natural and social sciences, from fields including 
        ecology, economics, geography, geology, glaciology, meteorology, oceanography, 
        climatology, paleontology, sociology, and space science.
    
        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>The Science Education Resource Center, <em>Carleton College</em>, offers the following 
        description: "Earth System science embraces chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics 
        and applied sciences in transcending disciplinary boundaries to treat the Earth as 
        an integrated system. It seeks a deeper understanding of the physical, chemical, 
        biological and human interactions that determine the past, current and future states 
        of the Earth. Earth System science provides a physical basis for understanding the 
        world in which we live and upon which humankind seeks to achieve sustainability.
        </p>

        <p> Earth System science has articulated four overarching, definitive and critically 
            important features of the Earth System, which include:
            <ol>
            <li><h3>Variability</h3></li>
            Many of the Earth System's natural 'modes' and variabilities across space and 
            time are beyond human experience, because of the stability of the recent Holocene. 
            Much Earth System science therefore relies on studies of the Earth's past 
            behaviour and models to anticipate future behaviour in response to pressures.
            <li><h3>Life</h3></li>
            Biological processes play a much stronger role in the functioning and responses 
            of the Earth System than previously thought. It appears to be integral to every 
            part of the Earth System.
            <li><h3>Connectivity</h3></li>
            Connectivity: Processes are connected in ways and across depths and lateral 
            distances that were previously unknown and inconceivable.
            <li><h3>Non-Linear</h3></li>
            Non-linear: The behaviour of the Earth System is typified by strong non-linearities. 
            This means that abrupt change can result when relatively small changes in a 
            'forcing function' push the System across a <strong>'threshold'</strong>.</p>
